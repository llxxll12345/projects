Greedy Snake

A JS project

The Greedy snake is the first page project that I have ever written.  The main structure is like this:

- initialization
- press button and start
- generate blocks
- set a timer , listen to events, do the right thing
- increase or decrease the interval of the timer according to events
- the snake touches itself, end game
- restart...

This is the sample of the structure. I'm now tring add a pause and resume function. The final aim is to put the project on a server and set a billboard of players. I will also add more factors into the calcuation of the final score. Let's wait and see.

By the way, the css style list are in file Greedy.css.

# Gobang web
- main scripts written by JQuery
- a simple UI, O/X chess, without pasting real pictures
- a simple and problematic artificial neuron network
- minimax algorithm and alpha-beta case reduction
- process beforehand the possible ways of winning, thus reducing the time of evaluating the situation, score is then added
- use regex(redundant and too complicated since I've processed the winning process, will be deleted in next version) to find certain type of situation for the input of the network
- a C++ MFC version is coming soon, will have a more complete neuron function and support switching from different function of stimulation
- to be updated...

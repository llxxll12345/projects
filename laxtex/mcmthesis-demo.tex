\section{Introduction}
We tackle $ 4 $ sub-problems:
\begin{itemize}[-]
\item \textbf{to find quantitative relationships between different energy sources}
\item \textbf{how to analyse four states energy structure and predict the future energy trends based on 1960 to 2009 data}
\item \textbf{how to quantify the "cleanness index" of four state energy structure}
\item \textbf{how to quantify and predict every factors impact on total renewable or non-renewable (fossil fuel) energy}
\end{itemize}


At first, we statistically analyse four state energy structure based on electricity, coal, LPG, and natural gas production and/or consumption structure. To find the association of different sectors consumption (transportation, commerce, residence, and industry etc.) with total consumption, we calculate the correlation coefficient and overall percentage for each sectors respectively. 
To address the second sub-problem, we use different regression models to fit the state-wide energy consumption and production structure over decades. Every regression models are calculated based on 50 years and 20 years data separately, and we will illustrate each model mathematical significance and assumptions. We project 2025 and 2050 energy profile based on our regression models while discussing each regression model implications potential weakness.\\

Next, we develop a hierarchical database model to define overall "cleanness index" based on each state energy production and consumption structure. We will quantify each energy source "cleanness" and develop an overall model to discuss the "cleanest" state.\\

Finally, we will associate other implicit factors, such as population growth and industrial development, with the changes in renewable energy and fossil fuel energy structure. We will recommend several policies for four state governors to reduce each state fossil fuels uses.


\subsection{Assumptions}
Our general assumptions are listed below. Additional assumptions may be added when performing further analysis.

\begin{enumerate}[1]
\item \textbf{The policy scenario for renewable energy and fossil fuels will not change from 2009 to 2050.}
\item \textbf{The technology of refining fossil fuels, exploit wind, solar, hydro, geothermal energy, transporting the electricity, natural gas, LPG will not achieve a breakthrough in the near future, particularly in 2050.}
\item \textbf{The mathematical significance of each regression model will be valid in predicting future energy trend. }
\item \textbf{Arizona, New Mexico, California, Texas regional climate, geography, and employable natural resources will be stable in the near future. That is, all carrying capacity for natural resources in 2050 will be essentially the same as in 2009. }
\item \textbf{All implicit factors are respectively independent.}
\end{enumerate}
